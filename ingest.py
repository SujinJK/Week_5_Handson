"""Ingest pipeline: load corpus files -> chunk -> embed locally -> store in Chroma.

Same pipeline as Week 3 (corpus, chunking, and embedding model are unchanged) --
here the resulting collection is queried by the agent's search_knowledge_base
tool (see rag_tool.py) instead of a standalone interactive Q&A script.

Reads both .md (plain text) and .pdf (extracted via pypdf) files from the
corpus directory, so the same pipeline can be pointed at a PDF corpus (e.g.
corpus_pdf/, see generate_sample_pdfs.py) to compare extraction quality
against the original markdown.

Run this once (or whenever the corpus directory changes) before running agent.py:
    python ingest.py               # ingests corpus/ (default)
    python ingest.py corpus_pdf    # ingests a different directory instead

For readers new to RAG, this file does the "build the searchable database"
half of the pipeline (the "search it later" half lives in rag_tool.py):

1. Read each document's raw text (a whole file, however long).
2. "Chunk" it (see chunking.py) -- split that long text into small,
   self-contained pieces of a few sentences each, since it's much easier
   (and cheaper) to search over small pieces than one giant document.
3. "Embed" each chunk -- run it through a small AI model that turns it
   into a list of numbers representing its meaning (see rag_tool.py's
   docstring for more on what that buys us).
4. Store each chunk's text + its numbers + which file it came from in
   Chroma, a "vector database" built specifically for searching by these
   number-lists efficiently.

Every time this script runs, it wipes and rebuilds the whole database from
whatever's currently in corpus_dir -- so switching which folder you point
it at fully replaces what agent.py can search, it doesn't merge the two.
